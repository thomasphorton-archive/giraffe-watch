          p Ok, maybe it was at first.

          p Giraffe Watch began as a gag to poke fun at my friends who couldn’t peel their eyes off of April. We thought, just as most of you did, that it would happen “Any Minute Now” and we could send out an email to a few hundred of our friends and family to tune in. Six days, 27,000 subscribers and very few hours of sleep later, it is clear that any minute now isn’t the case! We have been in contact with Animal Adventure Park asking if they would like us to install the email alert system on their site for free or asking if they could notify us when April's labor begins so we could alert all of you but they said it was not a good business decision for them to have less people watching the camera. After all they are a for-profit organization so you can’t blame them. 

          p Our goal for this site was never to make money, but to help our homies out. So, after factoring out costs for running the Giraffe Watch alert service and buying a six pack, we will be donating the remainder to the <a href='https://giraffeconservation.org/' title='Donate to the Giraffe Conservation Foundation'>Giraffe Conservation Foundation</a>, a <strong>non-profit</strong> organization dedicated to a sustainable future for all giraffe populations in the wild. All donation links on our site have been directed to the GCF donation page, and I encourage you to show them some love. 100% of the Any Minute Now t-shirt profits will also be going to the GCF.

          p We will continue to monitor April and provide updates, although we will be scaling back our over-night commitments, and we will continue to work towards a way for you night-owls to alert the rest of the group. Any shift volunteers!?

          p Please reach out via the <a href='/comments' title='April the Giraffe Discussion'>comments page</a> with any concerns or to request a refund of your donation.

          p Thank you,

          p - Tom & Lindsey

          p We've hit another bottleneck- we're creating new subscriptions too fast. I'm researching a fix, in the meantime you should be able to get in eventually if you keep retrying.

          h2 Move to Crowd Sourcing
          h6 2/26/17 09:30

          p The baby still hasn't been born. I know, right? Trust me- I'm bummed out too. So I've got a request for you all. I'm getting tired. I need to go to work tomorrow. I can't keep this going for much longer.

          p
            b So we're crowd sourcing!

          p I've added a button on the <a href='/watch'>Giraffe Watch Stream</a> that you can click if you see something important happen. That message will get sent over to me, and if I see enough activity I'll verify it myself and start letting everyone know.

          p Alternatively, if you're really excited about it, <a href='mailto:giraffewatchapp@gmail.com?subject=Giraffe Activity'>shoot me an email</a> and I'll respond quickly.
